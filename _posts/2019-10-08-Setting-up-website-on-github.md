Today I was thinking that I must start writing blogs but it was not so intresting stuff so I searched about writing static blogs and eventually I came to know about jekyll and when I realised that it can be hosted on github as well with something like USERNAME.github.io(here USERNAME is your github username like in my case it is SuhelMehta9) then I felt excited and I decided to write blogs. And hence this is my first post!
Now I will show you how you can setup thest pages.

First of all login to github.
